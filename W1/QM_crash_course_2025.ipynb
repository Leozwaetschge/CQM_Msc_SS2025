In finite systems, however, exact diagonalization at finite $h$ always finds a ground state that is a superposition of configurations in such a way that the magnetization vanishes, and eventually, if $h$ is small enough ($\\sim 0$), ED will \"choose\" either the all up-state or the all-down state as the ground state, even though there is effectively a degeneracy. In the thermodynamic limit, if $h/J < 1$, what really happens is the system \"chooses\" one of the two symmetry broken regimes (based on \"past history\") and spontaneous nonzero magnetization appears, since the other symmetry broken regime (all spins flipped) cannot be reached in finite time by local fluctuations (individual spin flips) due to the infinite number of spins present in the system.
