        "What is it all necessary for? The splitting of the Hamiltonian into the subsectors allows us to save considerable computational effort for large systems. If the Hilbert space is divided roughly into $m$ sectors, construction of one sector Hamiltonian generates an overhead of order $\\mathcal{O}(N^2 / m)$ (we iterate over $N / m$ orbitals and consider in the worst case $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ terms in each). Mostly the existing algorithms for finding the ground state of $H$ do that through consecutive application of $H$ to the trial vector. The cost of this operation is reduced as $\\mathcal{O}(N^2 / m^2)$ and most importantly this operation is repeated thousands of times.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another neat advantage of accounting for symmetries is that once you diagonalize the Hamiltonian in some specific sector, you immediately know its ground state properties (for instance, its momentum as in the case of $T$). Diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in the computational basis as a whole does not reflect the fact that the ground state properties can be quite subtle. For instance, in the region $|h| < 1$ the states $k = 0$ and $k = \\pi$ are degenerate and one's ED solver can mix these solutions when diagonalizing the full Hamiltonian."
