    "\n",
    "Before tackling the problems of finding the number of bound states and finding actual states, let us analyze the implemented methods and how we should use them to find solutions to the Schroedinger equation (and understand what we're actually doing). For bound states, we're interested in finding the finite number of solutions at negative energies. Our potential well of depth $-c/4$ at $x_{min} = 1/2$ further narrows the range of possible solutions: states with energy less than $-c/4$ will not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shooting method tells us that we have found an eigenstate of the Schroedinger equation, if integrating with  Numerov gives the same solution if done from the left as well as from the right. The matching condition is simplified to one statement: if the log-derivative of the two solutions match at $b$ with $V(b)=E$, then $E$ is an eigenvalue and the solution an eigenstate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can restate the problem at the core of this exercise: for every energy $-c/4 \\leq E \\leq 0$, get the log-derivative difference at $b=b(E)=1/2+\\sqrt{1/4 + E/c}$. Then search for all the roots of the log-derivative-differences. A root tells you that the energy is a solution.\n",
